        <h1>La Rochelle's 21/22 season</h1>

        <h2>A season marked by inconsistency</h2>

        <p>La Rochelle's 21/22 season can best be described as <strong>inconsistent</strong></p>

        <p>While the losses in the first few games seem to indicate that La Rochelle might struggle to bounce back from their Top 14 loss in the previous year, results slowly started coming back as the team gained confidence and started cashing in points.</p>

        <p>Although La Rochelle never strayed far from the Top 6, several significant losses throughout the season ensured that La Rochelle struggled for momentum all the way to the final day of the season, where an impressive win against Lyon guaranteed a spot in the playoffs at the <em>last possible moment.</em></p>

        <h2>A first major title, but continued disappointment for the Brennus</h2>

        <p>The highlight of the season undoubtedly has to be La Rochelle's historic win against Leinster in the Champions Cup final, securing a first major title for the club and sparking incredible celebrations across La Rochelle.
            
        <p>However, while the elation of winning the title did not die down, the season ended in disappointment as, once again, La Rochelle's season was ended by Toulouse in the quarter finals of the Top 14 playoff.</p>

        <p>La Rochelle fans will hope that a strong recruitment for the 22/23 season will allow them to finally take that extra step and secure a first Brennus for the club.</p>
